-- 1) About--
The following interactive infographic visually illustrates my usage of the video-sharing website YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/) over a two week period, between March 12 and March 26, 2018. Each graph is separated by YouTube video categories.

The main square graph, which features videos watched, minutes watched, total video views, and total video votes, is measured in the square area of a percentage out of 100 from the centre. The like/dislike bar below is measured in the percentage covered with likes, similar to the actual like/dislike bar on YouTube.

This graph was coded by using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript (JS).

--2) Disclaimers--
All data collected is for educational purposes, and I have no affiliation with YouTube or Google. Addition, the data collected is from the moment I viewed the video, so video statistic doesn't reflect their current data and/or availability.

Although the YouTube logo displayed is in the public domain as it does not meet the threshold of originality, it is still protected as a trademark, which belongs to YouTube themselves and the website's owner Google.

--3) Functionality--
HTML document has been tested and proven to work on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari. Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer are not supported. The document was not tested with Opera, although it should work fine on that browser.

--4) Instructions--
1) Double-click on 'index.html' to open the HTML document.
2) Click on a category button to change the displayed data.
3) Comedy, Education, Entertainment, Film & Animation, Howto & Style, and People & Blogs buttons display the data exclusive to said YouTube video category. Overall displays the data of all videos combined.

--5) Data descriptions--
• Videos watched:    The total number of videos I watched the category.

--7) Troubleshooting--
• The graph is not moving/animating.
